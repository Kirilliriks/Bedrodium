# Bedrodium
Minecraft mod (for FabricMC).

Requires Sodium.

Small optimization by removing the invisible sides of the bedrock (
More precisely, all the lower polygons of the chunk are removed)

I do not guarantee that this modification will work well.

In theory, this will help players on really weak computers, I hope for feedback if it helped them.
